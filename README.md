# Restaurant-management-system
 My final year highschool project. Created in C#(using windows form application for the front end) and SQL(local database).  It consists of a login part(different waiters can login and the orders they create are assigned to the logged waiter) and a order management part(each table has a different order which is remembered in the database)
